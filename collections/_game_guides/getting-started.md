Welcome to Ultima Online: New Renaissance! This guide will walk you through everything you need to know to begin your adventure in Britannia.

## Step 1: Download & Install

### Getting the Client

New Renaissance uses a custom launcher that automatically downloads and configures everything you need:

1. **Download the Launcher** - Click the "Download Client" button above
2. **Run the Installer** - Follow the installation prompts
3. **Launch the Game** - The launcher will download any required files
4. **Create Your Account** - Use the in-game account creation system

### System Requirements

## Step 2: Create Your Character

Once you've logged in, you'll begin the character creation process.

### Choose Your Race

New Renaissance features the classic UO race:

**Human**
- Most versatile and balanced
- No special abilities, but no restrictions
- Recommended for new players

Humans
The first playable race in Ultima Online. Humans naturally heal faster, and are more adept at basic resource gathering and can carry greater weights. Most significantly, they have the “Jack of All Trades” trait, which provides them a “hidden” minimum of 20 skill points in all skills – even ones they have not trained past 0. Humans are the most widespread race, with kingdoms in Britannia and the Lost Lands.

### Customize Your Appearance

- **Skin Tone** - Customize your character's appearance
- **Starting Clothes** - Select colors for your outfit

## Step 3: Choose Your Skills

New Renaissance uses the classic 700 total skill point system. When creating your character, you'll distribute your starting skills.

### Stats

You have **225 total stat points** to distribute among three attributes:

- **Strength (STR)** - Affects HP, melee damage, and carry weight

## Step 4: Choose Your Starting Location

When you enter the world, you'll select your starting city. Each location offers different advantages:

### Recommended Starting Locations

**Britain** ⭐ *Recommended for New Players*

## Step 5: Your First Steps

### Essential Commands

Learn these commands immediately:

- `bank` - Open your bankbox (must be near banker)
- `[help` - Display list of custom commands
- `[time` - Check current server time

### Banking Your Items

**Always bank your valuables!** Your bankbox is 100% secure storage.

1. Find a banker NPC (in any major city)
2. Stand next to them and say "bank"
3. Your bankbox will open
4. Deposit your gold and important items

### Understanding the Interface

**Paperdoll (Character Window)**

### Young Player Status

New characters receive "Young" status which provides:
- Protection from other players
- Cannot be stolen from

**Duration:** "Young" status is affected by your total playtime with your account, and is not calculated on a per-character basis. A player loses their "Young" status if they spend more than 40 hours logged into UO and have more than 450 total skill points.
Players can also end their "Young" status by saying the words, "I renounce my young player status".

### Death & Resurrection

When you die:
